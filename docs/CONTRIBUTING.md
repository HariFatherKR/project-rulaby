## Before you begin

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

If you or your current employer have already signed the CLA (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

Visit our CLA page to see your current agreements or to sign a new one.

### Review our Community Guidelines

This project follows our Open Source Community Guidelines. Please review and adhere to them.

## Contribution Process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) for this purpose.

### Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review and merge your PRs quickly, please follow these guidelines. PRs that do not meet these standards may be closed.

#### 1. Link to an Existing Issue

All PRs should be linked to an existing issue in our tracker. This ensures that every change has been discussed and is aligned with the project's goals before any code is written.

- **For bug fixes:** The PR should be linked to the bug report issue.
- **For features:** The PR should be linked to the feature request or proposal issue that has been approved by a maintainer.

If an issue for your change doesn't exist, please **open one first** and wait for feedback before you start coding.

#### 2. Keep It Small and Focused

We favor small, atomic PRs that address a single issue or add a single, self-contained feature.

- **Do:** Create a PR that fixes one specific bug or adds one specific feature.
- **Don't:** Bundle multiple unrelated changes (e.g., a bug fix, a new feature, and a refactor) into a single PR.

Large changes should be broken down into a series of smaller, logical PRs that can be reviewed and merged independently.

#### 3. Write Clear and Descriptive Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation updates
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code restructuring
- `test:` for adding or updating tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
